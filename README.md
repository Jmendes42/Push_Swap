# Push_Swap

The objective of this project was to create a powerful yet simple sorting algorithm.

Two arrays are given, one can have as many numbers as the user wants, and the other is empty.

Push Swap will sort the numbers in the first array by swapping them with the second one in the minimum steps possible.
